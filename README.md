# cafemgr
A cafe invoicing and promo application that takes order and optionally applies promo.

After showing menu with numbered items, it will take a comma separated input (eg. 1,5).
An additional question for stamp card is asked in Y/N (eg. 'n').
Based on the input codes it will build an order and print the receipt.

Promos are applied based on stamp card with 2 criteria:
1. Beverage and snack is ordered, then 1 extra free
2. Every 5th Beverage ordered is free

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:
- JDK 8
- Gradle

## Tests
 * In the root folder 'cafemgr' run the following:
  ```
     ./gradlew clean test
  ```
  
## Running application locally
 * In the root folder 'cafemgr' run the following:
  ```
     ./gradlew clean run
  ```
## Approach / assumptions
 * User input is from the command line.
 * Inputs are the numeric values of menu item with price to keep it simple.
 * The stamp is checked against the Y/N input provided.
 * No customer information is stored, and each order is checked against a new stamp card.
 * The order then updates the stamp card against the promo offers.
 * Snack+Beverage Free Promo is applied to 1st EXTRA ordered in the list.
 * 5th Free Beverage PROMO is applied to 5th BEVERAGE irrespective of cost.
 * Discounts are printed with price of 0 to simplify display.
 
 ## Test Cases Covered in JUnit
  * User inputs for both valid and invalid cases.
  * Order processing for simple orders w/o stamp card, stamp card EXTRA PROMO and BEVERAGE PROMO.
